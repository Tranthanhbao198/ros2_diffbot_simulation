# Differential Drive Robot Simulation on ROS 2 Humble ü§ñ

This is a simulation project for a differential drive robot using **ROS 2 Humble** and **Gazebo**.

## ‚ñ∫ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   Ubuntu 22.04
*   ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
*   Gazebo (typically installed with `ros-humble-desktop`)
*   Colcon (the standard build tool for ROS 2)
*   Git

---

## ‚ñ∫ Installation and Build Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and build the project.

### 1. Create a Workspace and Clone the Project

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new workspace directory and its src folder
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src

# Navigate into the src directory
cd ~/ros2_ws/src

# Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/Tranthanhbao198/ros2_diffbot_simulation.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Before building, you need to install the necessary packages for simulation and control.

```bash
# Navigate to the root of your workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws

# Update your system's package list
sudo apt update

# Install the required dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y \
  ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs \
  ros-humble-ros2-control \
  ros-humble-ros2-controllers \
  ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
```

### 3. Build the Workspace

Use `colcon` to build all packages in the workspace.

```bash
# Navigate to the root of your workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws

# Build the project
colcon build
```
A successful build will end with a message like: `Summary: 1 package finished`.

---

## ‚ñ∫ Usage Instructions

After a successful build, you can launch the simulation.

### 1. Source the Workspace

In every new terminal session, you must source the workspace environment so that ROS 2 can find your packages.

```bash
# Source the workspace's setup file
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
> **Note:** You must run this command in **every new terminal** where you intend to use this workspace.

### 2. Launch the Simulation

Now, use the `ros2 launch` command to start the simulation in Gazebo.

```bash
ros2 launch diffbot_sim diffbot.launch.py
```

A Gazebo window will open with the robot model. You can now start interacting with and controlling the robot through ROS 2 topics.
Of course! Here is that section translated into English, formatted with Markdown to continue directly from the previous part of your `README.md` file.

### 3. Controlling the Robot with a Keyboard (Teleop)

Once the simulation is running, you can control the robot's movement using the `teleop_twist_keyboard` package. There are two ways to do this.

#### Method 1: Run Teleop in a Separate Terminal (Recommended for Testing)

This method is quick and easy, perfect for verifying that your robot is working correctly.

**A. Launch the Simulation**

First, make sure your simulation is running. Open **Terminal 1**, source your workspace, and run the launch file:```bash
# Terminal 1
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch diffbot_sim diffbot.launch.py
```

**B. Launch Keyboard Teleop**

Open a **NEW Terminal (Terminal 2)**, source the workspace, and run the `teleop_twist_keyboard` node. We need to **remap** the default `cmd_vel` topic to the topic our robot's controller is listening to, which is `/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped`.

```bash
# Terminal 2
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args --remap cmd_vel:=/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped
```

**C. Start Driving**

1.  **Click on the Terminal 2 window** to give it **focus**.
2.  Use the following keys to control the robot in Gazebo:
    ```
           i
        j     l
           ,
    ```
    - `i`: move forward
    - `,`: move backward
    - `j`: turn left
    - `l`: turn right
    - `u/o/m/.`: move diagonally
    - `k`: stop
    - `q/z`: increase/decrease speed

---
#### Method 2: Integrate into a Launch File (Advanced)

This method allows you to start both the simulation and the teleop node with a single command.

**A. Create a New Launch File**

Create a new file named `full_sim.launch.py` inside your package's `launch` directory.
```bash
# From your workspace root (~/ros2_ws)
cd src/ros2_diffbot_simulation/diffbot_sim/launch/
touch full_sim.launch.py
```

**B. Add Content to the Launch File**

Open `full_sim.launch.py` and paste the following content into it:

```python
import os

from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():

    # Include the robot simulation launch file
    diffbot_launch_path = os.path.join(
        get_package_share_directory('diffbot_sim'),
        'launch',
        'diffbot.launch.py'
    )

    included_launch = IncludeLaunchDescription(
        PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(diffbot_launch_path)
    )

    # Launch the teleop_twist_keyboard node in a new terminal window
    teleop_node = Node(
        package='teleop_twist_keyboard',
        executable='teleop_twist_keyboard',
        name='teleop_node',
        output='screen',
        prefix='xterm -e',  # This opens a new xterm terminal for the node
        remappings=[
            ('cmd_vel', '/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped')
        ]
    )

    return LaunchDescription([
        included_launch,
        teleop_node
    ])
```
> **Explanation:** The `prefix='xterm -e'` argument is very important. It automatically opens a new terminal window just for the teleop node, which is necessary because the node needs to capture your keyboard input.

**C. Rebuild the Workspace**

Since you added a new file, rebuild your package so the system can find it.
```bash
# Return to the workspace root
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select diffbot_sim
```

**D. Run the Combined Launch File**

Now, you only need to run this new launch file.
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch diffbot_sim full_sim.launch.py
```
A Gazebo window and a new terminal window will open automatically. **Click on the new terminal window** and start driving the robot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting: Robot Doesn't Move

If you press the keys but the robot doesn't move, check these common issues:
1.  **Terminal Not in Focus**: This is the most common problem. Make sure you have clicked on the terminal window running the teleop node before pressing keys.
2.  **Commands Are Not Being Sent**: Open a third terminal and run `ros2 topic echo /diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped`. Then go back to the teleop terminal and press keys. If you don't see any messages in the third terminal, the command is not being sent (see issue #1).
3.  **Controller is Inactive**: Open another terminal and run `ros2 control list_controllers`. Ensure that `diff_cont` has an `active` state.
